echo "Testing Batch History Time Tracking Implementation"
echo "=================================================="

echo ""
echo "1. Database Migration Test"
echo "   - New columns: ended_at, time_spent"
echo "   - Check migration 0072_add_batch_time_tracking.up.sql"

echo ""
echo "2. Backend Model Changes"
echo "   - BatchHistory struct now includes EndedAt and TimeSpent fields"
echo "   - Repository has UpdateStatusWithEndTime method"
echo "   - Service layer updated to track completion times"

echo ""
echo "3. Updated Process Types That Now Track Time:"
echo "   - shopee_status_batch (reconcile_service.go)"
echo "   - reconcile_batch_creation (reconcile_service.go)"
echo "   - reconcile_batch (reconcile_service.go)"
echo "   - streaming_dropship_import (streaming_import_processor.go)"
echo "   - reconcile_chunk (reconcile_stream.go)"
echo "   - ads_performance_sync (ads_performance_batch_scheduler.go)"
echo "   - shopee_order_detail_fetch (shopee_detail_background_service.go)"
echo "   - dropship_import (dropship_handler.go)"

echo ""
echo "4. Frontend Changes"
echo "   - BatchHistory interface updated with ended_at and time_spent"
echo "   - BatchHistoryPage now displays 'Ended' and 'Duration' columns"
echo "   - Duration formatted for human readability (e.g., '2h 30m 15s')"

echo ""
echo "5. API Changes"
echo "   - No breaking changes to existing endpoints"
echo "   - All batch history endpoints now return time tracking data"
echo "   - New fields are nullable, so existing data is compatible"

echo ""
echo "6. Testing Done"
echo "   - Unit tests for repository layer pass"
echo "   - Service layer tests pass (fake implementation updated)"
echo "   - Frontend builds successfully"
echo "   - Backend builds successfully"

echo ""
echo "To test the functionality:"
echo "1. Start the backend server (migration will run automatically)"
echo "2. Create a batch process (e.g., import dropship data)"
echo "3. View the batch history page to see start time, end time, and duration"
echo "4. Completed/failed batches will show actual processing time"
